# Reliable service calls with Python

This project is based heavily on Chapter 5, "Stability Patterns," of the book *Release It!* by Michael Nygard.

A detailed README and robust code examples will explain how to use core stability patterns to make service calls in Python more reliable. These include:

* Using the Circuit Breaker pattern
* Using timeouts
* Using retries, with and without "fuzzing" (and why you want to fuzz retries)
* Using graceful fallbacks
